## Check INFO Tool - ATE Program Test Condition Extractor

### Overview

The Check INFO Tool streamlines the process of extracting critical test conditions from ATE test programs. This tool helps engineers quickly and accurately retrieve information such as pattern usage, flow binning details, power pin levels, and AC/timing data, significantly reducing the time and effort required for program quality checks.

### Background

- **Challenge**: Engineers often need to manually search through ATE test programs to find specific test conditions, a process that is both time-consuming and prone to errors.
- **Drawbacks**: Manual lookups among sheets require extensive time and effort, making program quality checks inefficient.

### Features

- **Automated Extraction of Test Conditions**
- **Pattern Usage Identification**
- **Flow Binning Information Retrieval**
- **Power Pin Level Extraction**
- **AC/Timing Data Extraction**
- **User-Friendly Interface**
